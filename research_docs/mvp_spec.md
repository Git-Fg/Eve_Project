# MVP Specification

## Introduction
This document outlines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) specification for our NLP project focused on language generation with cultural context preservation. The MVP will serve as the initial version of our product, containing core functionalities that can be tested and iterated upon based on user feedback.

## Core Features

1. Language Selection
   - Support for 2-3 target languages
   - User interface for language selection

2. Basic Language Generation
   - Text generation capability using pre-trained language models
   - Support for short to medium-length text outputs

3. Simple Cultural Context Integration
   - Basic integration of cultural elements in generated text
   - Minimal database of cultural references for each supported language

4. Minimal User Interface
   - Text input area for prompts or starting phrases
   - Output display area for generated text
   - Language selection dropdown
   - Generate button to initiate text generation

## User Stories

1. Language Selection
   - As a user, I want to select my desired language so that I can generate text in that specific language.

2. Basic Language Generation
   - As a user, I want to input a prompt or starting phrase so that the system can generate relevant text based on my input.
   - As a user, I want to generate text of varying lengths so that I can use the output for different purposes.

3. Simple Cultural Context Integration
   - As a user, I want the generated text to include basic cultural references so that the output feels more authentic to the selected language and culture.

4. Minimal User Interface
   - As a user, I want a simple interface to input my prompt and view the generated text so that I can easily interact with the system.
   - As a user, I want to be able to initiate text generation with a single click so that I can quickly get results.

## Feature Prioritization (MoSCoW)

### Must Have
- Support for at least 2 target languages
- Basic text generation capability
- Simple user interface with input area, output display, and generate button
- Language selection feature

### Should Have
- Support for 3 target languages
- Integration of basic cultural context in generated text
- Ability to generate text of different lengths (short to medium)

### Could Have
- User account system for saving generated texts
- Option to regenerate text with the same prompt
- Basic error handling and input validation

### Won't Have (for MVP)
- Advanced cultural context integration
- Support for more than 3 languages
- Text editing features within the interface
- Advanced customization of language model parameters

This MVP specification provides a solid foundation for our initial product release, focusing on core functionalities while leaving room for future enhancements based on user feedback and further development.
