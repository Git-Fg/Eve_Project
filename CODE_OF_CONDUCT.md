# Code of Conduct for EVE (Écosystème linguistique Virtuel Évolutif)

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, welcoming, and culturally diverse environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to respect and celebrate the rich tapestry of human linguistic and cultural diversity that forms the core of the EVE project, as outlined in our [Vision and Objectives](https://github.com/Git-Fg/Eve_Project/wiki/Vision-and-Objectives).

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community and the preservation of linguistic diversity
* Showing empathy towards other community members and the cultures they represent
* Adhering to our [Ethical Framework](https://github.com/Git-Fg/Eve_Project/wiki/Ethical-Framework) in all interactions

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Disrespecting or dismissing any language or cultural practice
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Violating the principles outlined in our [Ethical Framework](https://github.com/Git-Fg/Eve_Project/wiki/Ethical-Framework)

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

For more information on how to engage with our community, please refer to our [Community Engagement](https://github.com/Git-Fg/Eve_Project/wiki/Community-Engagement) guidelines.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [conduct@eveproject.org](mailto:conduct@eveproject.org). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
