Based on the search results and my knowledge of French language resources, I can provide information on several high-quality text datasets suitable for Parisian French language analysis and NLP tasks. Here's a comprehensive overview of five relevant datasets:

1. [CFPP2000 (Corpus de Français Parlé Parisien des années 2000)](https://cocoon.huma-num.fr/exist/crdo/meta/cocoon-8bc96a4e-9899-30e4-99be-c72d216eb38b)
   - Name and description: Corpus of Spoken Parisian French from the 2000s
   - Source: Created by researchers at the Université Paris 3 - Sorbonne Nouvelle
   - Size: Approximately 36 hours of recorded speech, transcribed into text
   - Type of text: Conversational interviews with Parisian residents
   - Parisian French features: Captures authentic spoken Parisian French, including colloquialisms and regional expressions
   - Potential use cases: Sociolinguistic studies, speech recognition, conversational AI training

2. [French Treebank](http://ftb.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/index.php?langue=en)
   - Name and description: Syntactically annotated corpus of French texts
   - Source: Developed at the Université Paris 7
   - Size: Over 1 million words
   - Type of text: Primarily newspaper articles from "Le Monde"
   - Parisian French features: Represents standard written French, often associated with Parisian usage
   - Potential use cases: Syntactic parsing, part-of-speech tagging, linguistic analysis

3. [ESLO (Enquêtes Sociolinguistiques à Orléans)](http://eslo.huma-num.fr/index.php/pagecorpus/pageaccescorpus)
   - Name and description: Sociolinguistic survey corpus from Orléans
   - Source: Université d'Orléans
   - Size: Over 700 hours of recorded speech with transcriptions
   - Type of text: Interviews, conversations, and public speeches
   - Parisian French features: While not strictly Parisian, it captures standard French close to Parisian usage
   - Potential use cases: Sociolinguistic research, speech analysis, dialect studies

4. FrenchSemEval
   - Name and description: French dataset for semantic evaluation tasks
   - Source: Created for SemEval (Semantic Evaluation) competitions
   - Size: Varies by task, typically thousands of annotated sentences
   - Type of text: News articles, social media posts, and general web content
   - Parisian French features: Represents contemporary French usage, including Parisian styles
   - Potential use cases: Sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, semantic role labeling

5. FRANTEXT
   - Name and description: Large corpus of French literary texts
   - Source: ATILF (Analyse et Traitement Informatique de la Langue Française)
   - Size: Over 250 million words from 5,000+ texts
   - Type of text: Literary works, essays, and scientific texts from the 12th to 21st centuries
   - Parisian French features: Includes many works by Parisian authors, reflecting the city's literary tradition
   - Potential use cases: Diachronic linguistic studies, literary analysis, language modeling

These datasets capture the unique characteristics of Parisian French in several ways:

- The CFPP2000 directly focuses on Parisian speakers, providing authentic samples of the local dialect.
- The French Treebank, while not exclusively Parisian, represents the standard French often associated with Parisian usage, especially in formal contexts.
- ESLO, though centered on Orléans, captures a variety of French close to the Parisian standard.
- FrenchSemEval includes contemporary usage that often reflects Parisian influences on modern French.
- FRANTEXT's literary corpus showcases the historical development of French, with significant Parisian contributions.

Additional resources that complement these datasets for studying Parisian French include:

- Lexique.org: A lexical database of French providing phonological and grammatical information
- NoDA-FR: A corpus of spoken French annotated for discourse analysis
- CLAPI: A platform for spoken French corpora, including some Parisian samples
- FranceTerme: Official French terminology database, often reflecting Parisian usage in formal contexts

These resources, combined with the mentioned datasets, provide a robust foundation for researching and developing NLP applications focused on Parisian French. They cover various aspects of the language, from colloquial speech to formal written text, allowing researchers to capture the nuances of Parisian French in different contexts[1][2][3].
