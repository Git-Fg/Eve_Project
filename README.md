# EVE Project (Écosystème linguistique Virtuel Évolutif)

## About EVE

The Evolving Virtual Linguistic Ecosystem (EVE) project is a revolutionary initiative aimed at preserving and evolving human expression in all its diversity. In a world where a language dies every two weeks, EVE stands as a guardian of cognitive and cultural wealth, using cutting-edge technology to safeguard unique ways of perceiving, thinking, and interacting with our environment.

## Objective

Our fundamental goal is to create a dynamic linguistic ecosystem that captures not only words but also the cultural contexts, gestures, tones, and even the silences that give life to a language. We aim to:

- Preserve and revitalize endangered languages
- Create immersive learning experiences
- Facilitate ethical and collaborative linguistic evolution
- Develop a deeper understanding of the relationship between language, culture, and cognition
