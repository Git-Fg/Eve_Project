## Step 7: Collaborative Evolution and Community Governance (3 weeks)

### Week 1: Community Engagement Platform Development

#### Day 1-2: User Contribution System
1. Develop a user contribution platform:
   - Create interfaces for users to submit new words, phrases, and cultural context
   - Implement a moderation queue for reviewing submissions
   - Design a reputation system to reward active and valuable contributors
2. Integrate the contribution system with the core language model and cultural database

#### Day 3-4: Collaborative Editing Tools
1. Implement collaborative editing features:
   - Develop a wiki-style interface for community-driven language documentation
   - Create tools for collaborative translation and interpretation
   - Implement version control for tracking changes in language entries
2. Integrate real-time collaboration features using WebSockets

#### Day 5: Community Forums and Discussion Boards
1. Set up community engagement spaces:
   - Implement forums for discussing language evolution and cultural topics
   - Create chat rooms for real-time language practice and cultural exchange
   - Develop a system for organizing language-specific events and meetups

### Week 2: Democratic Governance System

#### Day 1-2: Voting and Decision-Making Mechanisms
1. Implement a democratic decision-making system:
   - Develop voting mechanisms for language changes and new additions
   - Create a proposal system for suggesting new features or policy changes
   - Implement weighted voting based on user reputation and expertise
2. Integrate the voting system with the language evolution module

#### Day 3-4: Cultural Advisory Boards
1. Develop a platform for cultural advisory boards:
   - Create interfaces for nominating and electing board members
   - Implement tools for board members to review and guide language evolution
   - Develop a system for board members to interact with the wider community
2. Integrate advisory board decisions with the ethical governance system

#### Day 5: Transparency and Accountability Tools
1. Implement transparency features:
   - Create dashboards to visualize community contributions and decisions
   - Develop an audit trail for tracking the evolution of language entries
   - Implement public reporting tools for community metrics and governance decisions

### Week 3: Language Vitality and Resource Allocation

#### Day 1-2: Language Vitality Index
1. Develop a comprehensive Language Vitality Index:
   - Create algorithms to assess language usage, growth, and community engagement
   - Implement visualizations to track language vitality over time
   - Develop alerts for languages at risk of decline
2. Integrate the vitality index with the resource allocation system

#### Day 3-4: Resource Allocation System
1. Implement an AI-driven resource allocation system:
   - Develop algorithms to distribute computational resources based on language vitality
   - Create a system for allocating human resources (e.g., linguists, cultural experts)
   - Implement adaptive learning strategies to optimize resource utilization
2. Integrate the resource allocation system with the overall EVE architecture

#### Day 5: Testing and Documentation
1. Conduct thorough testing of collaborative evolution and governance features:
   - Perform simulations of community decision-making processes
   - Test the resource allocation system under various scenarios
2. Create comprehensive documentation:
   - Update `docs/community_guidelines.md` with governance procedures
   - Develop a user guide for community contribution in `docs/contribution_guide.md`
   - Document the technical architecture of governance systems in `docs/governance_architecture.md`

### Deliverables for Step 7
1. User contribution and collaborative editing platform
2. Community forums and discussion boards
3. Democratic voting and decision-making system
4. Cultural advisory board platform
5. Transparency and accountability tools
6. Language Vitality Index and visualization system
7. AI-driven resource allocation system
8. Documentation including community guidelines, contribution guide, and governance architecture
9. Test results and simulation reports

### Next Steps
- Integrate collaborative evolution and governance features into all aspects of EVE
- Plan for a beta testing phase with selected language communities
- Begin development of the final integration and system optimization (Step 8)
