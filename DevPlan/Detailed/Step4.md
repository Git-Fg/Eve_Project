## Step 4: User Interface Development (2 weeks)

### Week 1: Design and Frontend Setup

#### Day 1: UI/UX Design
1. Create wireframes and mockups for the main interface components:
   - Language selection and cultural context setting
   - Text generation and interaction area
   - Cultural information display
   - User profile and settings
2. Design a culturally adaptive interface that changes based on the selected language/culture
3. Document design decisions in `docs/ui_design.md`

#### Day 2: Frontend Project Setup
1. Set up a React project using Create React App or Next.js
2. Configure TypeScript for type safety
3. Set up styling solution (e.g., Styled Components or Tailwind CSS)
4. Implement basic routing using React Router

#### Day 3-4: Core Components Development
1. Develop reusable UI components:
   - LanguageSelector: For choosing the target language
   - CulturalContextSetter: To define the cultural context for interactions
   - TextGenerationArea: For inputting prompts and displaying generated text
   - CulturalInfoCard: To show relevant cultural information
2. Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop views
3. Create a theme system that adapts to different cultural contexts

#### Day 5: State Management and API Integration
1. Set up Redux or Context API for state management
2. Implement API service layer using Axios or Fetch API
3. Create actions and reducers for interacting with the backend API
4. Implement error handling and loading states

### Week 2: Advanced Features and Refinement

#### Day 1-2: Immersive Learning Module Integration
1. Develop a basic gamified learning experience component:
   - Create interactive exercises based on generated content
   - Implement a progress tracking system
   - Design culturally appropriate rewards and feedback mechanisms
2. Integrate audio playback for pronunciation practice
3. Implement a simple visualization for language statistics and learning progress

#### Day 3: Accessibility and Internationalization
1. Implement ARIA attributes for improved accessibility
2. Set up react-intl or react-i18next for interface translations
3. Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
4. Test and optimize for different browsers and devices

#### Day 4: Performance Optimization and Testing
1. Implement code splitting and lazy loading for improved performance
2. Set up unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library
3. Perform end-to-end testing using Cypress
4. Optimize bundle size and loading times

#### Day 5: Documentation and Final Polishing
1. Write comprehensive documentation for the frontend codebase
2. Create user guides for the interface in `docs/user_guide.md`
3. Perform a final round of UI/UX refinements based on testing feedback
4. Prepare a demo video showcasing the user interface and its features

### Week 3: Data Augmentation and Quality Assurance

#### Day 1-2: Text Data Augmentation
1. Implement advanced data augmentation techniques in `src/utils/text_augmenter.py`:
   - Use GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 for synthetic data generation
   - Implement context-aware augmentation to preserve cultural nuances
   - Develop a pipeline for generating culturally appropriate paraphrases
2. Apply augmentation to processed text data, focusing more on Ainu to increase the dataset size

#### Day 3: Audio Data Augmentation
1. Implement audio augmentation techniques in `src/utils/audio_augmenter.py`:
   - Time stretching and pitch shifting
   - Adding background noise
   - Speed perturbation
   - Use Gemini 1.5 for generating synthetic audio descriptions
2. Apply audio augmentation, especially to Ainu recordings to increase diversity

#### Day 4: Data Quality Assurance
1. Develop quality checking scripts in `src/utils/quality_checker.py`:
   - Implement advanced language detection using LLaMA 3 70B
   - Use Gemma 2 27B for semantic coherence checking
   - Verify audio file integrity and quality
2. Run quality checks on all processed and augmented data
3. Manual review of a sample of augmented data to ensure quality and cultural appropriateness

#### Day 5: Final Data Organization and Documentation
1. Organize all processed and augmented data into a clear directory structure
2. Create metadata files for each dataset, including:
   - Source information
   - Processing steps applied
   - Statistics (e.g., word count, audio duration)
   - Model used for synthetic data generation
3. Document the entire data collection and preprocessing process in `docs/data_preprocessing.md`
4. Update the project README with information about the datasets and augmentation techniques

### Deliverables for Step 4
1. Responsive and culturally adaptive user interface
2. Core components for language interaction and cultural context setting
3. Basic immersive learning module integrated into the main interface
4. Comprehensive frontend test suite
5. User documentation and guides
6. Performance optimization report

### Next Steps
- Integrate the user interface with the backend API (Step 3)
- Begin development of the advanced immersive learning module (Step 5)
- Plan for user testing and feedback collection
