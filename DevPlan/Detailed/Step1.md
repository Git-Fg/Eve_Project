## Step 1: Project Setup and Research (2 weeks)

### Week 1: Environment Setup and Initial Research

#### Day 1-2: Development Environment Setup
1. Install and configure essential software:
   - Python 3.9+ (latest stable version)
   - Git for version control
   - Visual Studio Code or PyCharm as the IDE
   - Anaconda for environment management

2. Set up a virtual environment for the project:
   ```
   conda create -n eve_project python=3.9
   conda activate eve_project
   ```

3. Initialize a Git repository and create a .gitignore file:
   ```
   git init
   curl https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/python,vscode,pycharm > .gitignore
   ```

4. Create a project structure:
   ```
   mkdir -p src/data src/models src/utils tests docs
   touch README.md requirements.txt
   ```

#### Day 3-4: NLP Libraries and Tools Research
1. Investigate and document key NLP libraries:
   - Hugging Face Transformers
   - spaCy
   - NLTK
   - FastText for word embeddings

2. Explore language model architectures:
   - BERT, GPT, T5
   - Multilingual models like mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa

3. Research data augmentation techniques for low-resource languages

4. Document findings in a Markdown file: `docs/nlp_tools_research.md`

#### Day 5: Linguistic Theories and Cultural Preservation
1. Study and summarize key linguistic theories:
   - Structuralism (de Saussure)
   - Post-structuralism (Derrida, Foucault)
   - Cognitive linguistics (Lakoff, Langacker)

2. Research methods for cultural context preservation in NLP:
   - Ethnolinguistic vitality theory
   - Cultural conceptualizations in language

3. Document findings in `docs/linguistic_theories.md`

### Week 2: Project Planning and Prototype Design

#### Day 1-2: Project Roadmap and Timeline
1. Create a high-level project roadmap using a Gantt chart:
   - Use a tool like ProjectLibre or an online service like TeamGantt
   - Include all 10 steps with estimated durations
   - Identify key milestones and deliverables

2. Develop a detailed timeline for the first three steps:
   - Break down tasks into daily or weekly goals
   - Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies

3. Document the roadmap and timeline in `docs/project_plan.md`

#### Day 3-4: MVP Feature Specification
1. Define the core features for the MVP:
   - Language selection (2-3 target languages)
   - Basic language generation capabilities
   - Simple cultural context integration
   - Minimal user interface for interaction

2. Create user stories for each core feature:
   ```
   As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit]
   ```

3. Prioritize features using the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)

4. Document the MVP specification in `docs/mvp_spec.md`

#### Day 5: Technical Architecture Design
1. Design the high-level system architecture:
   - Language model component
   - Cultural context database
   - User interface layer
   - API for inter-component communication

2. Create a data flow diagram showing how information moves through the system

3. Decide on initial technology stack:
   - Backend: Python with FastAPI or Flask
   - Frontend: React or Vue.js
   - Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for cultural data
   - Model serving: TensorFlow Serving or ONNX Runtime

4. Document the architecture in `docs/technical_architecture.md` and create a visual diagram using a tool like draw.io

### Deliverables for Step 1
1. Fully configured development environment
2. Git repository with initial project structure
3. Documentation:
   - `docs/nlp_tools_research.md`
   - `docs/linguistic_theories.md`
   - `docs/project_plan.md`
   - `docs/mvp_spec.md`
   - `docs/technical_architecture.md`
4. Initial `requirements.txt` file with core dependencies
5. Project roadmap and timeline (Gantt chart)
6. System architecture diagram

### Next Steps
- Review and refine the project plan
- Begin implementation of data collection and preprocessing (Step 2)
- Set up continuous integration for automated testing as the project progresses
