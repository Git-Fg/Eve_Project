## Step 2: Data Collection and Preprocessing (3 weeks)

### Week 1: Language Selection and Initial Data Gathering

#### Day 1: Language Selection and Research
1. Select target languages:
   - Well-resourced language: French
   - Endangered language: Ainu (indigenous language of Japan)
2. Research available resources for each language:
   - Corpora, dictionaries, academic papers, cultural resources
3. Document selection criteria and available resources in `docs/language_selection.md`

#### Day 2-3: Text Corpora Collection
1. French data collection:
   - Download French Wikipedia dump
   - Collect news articles from francophone sources
   - Gather literary texts from public domain sources (e.g., Project Gutenberg)
2. Ainu data collection:
   - Locate and acquire Ainu language resources (e.g., Ainu-Japanese dictionaries, transcribed oral stories)
   - Reach out to Ainu language preservation organizations for additional resources
3. Store raw data in `data/raw/french/` and `data/raw/ainu/` directories

#### Day 4-5: Audio Sample Collection
1. French audio collection:
   - Download public domain audiobooks in French
   - Collect news broadcasts and podcast samples
2. Ainu audio collection:
   - Locate recordings of Ainu speakers (songs, stories, conversations)
   - If possible, arrange recording sessions with Ainu speakers
3. Store audio files in `data/audio/french/` and `data/audio/ainu/` directories

### Week 2: Cultural Context Information and Data Cleaning

#### Day 1-2: Cultural Context Information Gathering
1. French cultural context:
   - Collect information on French customs, traditions, and social norms
   - Gather data on French history, art, and literature
2. Ainu cultural context:
   - Research Ainu traditions, rituals, and belief systems
   - Collect information on Ainu art, music, and oral traditions
3. Create JSON files to store cultural context data in `data/cultural_context/`

#### Day 3-4: Text Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
1. Develop text cleaning scripts in `src/utils/text_cleaner.py`:
   - Remove HTML tags and special characters
   - Normalize unicode characters
   - Handle language-specific cleaning (e.g., French accents, Ainu-specific characters)
2. Implement basic tokenization for each language
3. Remove duplicate content and filter out non-target language text
4. Apply cleaning scripts to raw text data and store processed data in `data/processed/`

#### Day 5: Audio Data Preprocessing
1. Develop audio preprocessing scripts in `src/utils/audio_processor.py`:
   - Convert audio to a consistent format (e.g., WAV, 16kHz, mono)
   - Trim silence and normalize volume
   - Split long audio files into manageable chunks
2. Apply preprocessing to audio files and store in `data/processed/audio/`

### Week 3: Data Augmentation and Quality Assurance

#### Day 1-2: Text Data Augmentation
1. Implement basic data augmentation techniques in `src/utils/text_augmenter.py`:
   - Synonym replacement (using WordNet for French, manual dictionary for Ainu)
   - Random insertion, deletion, and swap of words
   - Back-translation (for French, using an existing translation model)
2. Apply augmentation to processed text data, focusing more on Ainu to increase the dataset size

#### Day 3: Audio Data Augmentation
1. Implement audio augmentation techniques in `src/utils/audio_augmenter.py`:
   - Time stretching and pitch shifting
   - Adding background noise
   - Speed perturbation
2. Apply audio augmentation, especially to Ainu recordings to increase diversity

#### Day 4: Data Quality Assurance
1. Develop quality checking scripts in `src/utils/quality_checker.py`:
   - Language detection to ensure correct language in text corpus
   - Check for minimum and maximum text lengths
   - Verify audio file integrity and quality
2. Run quality checks on all processed and augmented data
3. Manual review of a sample of augmented data to ensure quality and cultural appropriateness

#### Day 5: Final Data Organization and Documentation
1. Organize all processed and augmented data into a clear directory structure
2. Create metadata files for each dataset, including:
   - Source information
   - Processing steps applied
   - Statistics (e.g., word count, audio duration)
3. Document the entire data collection and preprocessing process in `docs/data_preprocessing.md`
4. Update the project README with information about the datasets

### Week 3: Data Augmentation and Quality Assurance

#### Day 1-2: Text Data Augmentation
1. Implement advanced data augmentation techniques in `src/utils/text_augmenter.py`:
   - Use GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 for synthetic data generation
   - Implement context-aware augmentation to preserve cultural nuances
   - Develop a pipeline for generating culturally appropriate paraphrases
2. Apply augmentation to processed text data, focusing more on Ainu to increase the dataset size

#### Day 3: Audio Data Augmentation
1. Implement audio augmentation techniques in `src/utils/audio_augmenter.py`:
   - Time stretching and pitch shifting
   - Adding background noise
   - Speed perturbation
   - Use Gemini 1.5 for generating synthetic audio descriptions
2. Apply audio augmentation, especially to Ainu recordings to increase diversity

#### Day 4: Data Quality Assurance
1. Develop quality checking scripts in `src/utils/quality_checker.py`:
   - Implement advanced language detection using LLaMA 3 70B
   - Use Gemma 2 27B for semantic coherence checking
   - Verify audio file integrity and quality
2. Run quality checks on all processed and augmented data
3. Manual review of a sample of augmented data to ensure quality and cultural appropriateness

#### Day 5: Final Data Organization and Documentation
1. Organize all processed and augmented data into a clear directory structure
2. Create metadata files for each dataset, including:
   - Source information
   - Processing steps applied
   - Statistics (e.g., word count, audio duration)
   - Model used for synthetic data generation
3. Document the entire data collection and preprocessing process in `docs/data_preprocessing.md`
4. Update the project README with information about the datasets and augmentation techniques

### Deliverables for Step 2
1. Cleaned and preprocessed text corpora for French and Ainu
2. Processed audio samples for both languages
3. Structured cultural context data in JSON format
4. Data augmentation scripts for text and audio
5. Quality assurance scripts and reports
6. Comprehensive documentation of the data collection and preprocessing process
7. Updated project README and data-specific documentation

### Next Steps
- Review the collected and processed data to ensure it meets the project's needs
- Begin planning for the core language model development (Step 3)
- Consider reaching out to linguistic experts for validation of the Ainu language data
