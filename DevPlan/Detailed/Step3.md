## Step 3: Core Language Model Development

### Week 1: Model Selection and Initial Setup

#### Day 1-2: Model Research and Selection
1. Evaluate pre-trained language models suitable for multilingual fine-tuning:
   - LLaMA 3 70B for its advanced multilingual capabilities
   - Gemma 2 9B and 27B for their efficiency and performance
   - Consider GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 for synthetic data generation
2. Document model comparison and selection rationale in `docs/model_selection.md`

#### Day 3-4: Development Environment Setup
1. Set up GPU-enabled development environment:
   - Configure CUDA and cuDNN for GPU acceleration
   - Install PyTorch and Transformers library
2. Create a model experimentation notebook: `notebooks/model_experiments.ipynb`
3. Implement data loading and preprocessing pipeline in `src/data/data_loader.py`:
   - Handle both French and Ainu datasets
   - Implement tokenization using the selected model's tokenizer

#### Day 5: Initial Model Testing
1. Load pre-trained LLaMA 3 70B and Gemma 2 27B models
2. Perform initial inference tests on sample data from both languages
3. Document baseline performance metrics in `docs/baseline_performance.md`

### Week 2: Fine-tuning and Adaptation

#### Day 1-2: French Language Fine-tuning
1. Implement fine-tuning script in `src/models/fine_tune.py`:
   - Use Hugging Face's Trainer API for efficient fine-tuning
   - Implement gradient accumulation and mixed precision training
2. Fine-tune LLaMA 3 70B on the French dataset
3. Evaluate performance on French language tasks (e.g., text generation, classification)

#### Day 3-4: Ainu Language Adaptation
1. Implement techniques for low-resource language adaptation:
   - Few-shot learning approaches using Gemma 2 9B
   - Meta-learning techniques if applicable
2. Adapt the model to the Ainu dataset
3. Evaluate performance on Ainu language tasks

#### Day 5: Cross-lingual Transfer
1. Experiment with cross-lingual transfer techniques:
   - Zero-shot cross-lingual transfer using LLaMA 3 70B
   - Translate-train approach if necessary
2. Evaluate model's ability to generalize across both languages
3. Document findings in `docs/cross_lingual_performance.md`

### Week 3: Cultural Context Integration

#### Day 1-2: Cultural Embedding Layer
1. Design and implement a cultural embedding layer in `src/models/cultural_embedding.py`:
   - Create embeddings for cultural concepts and contexts
   - Develop mechanism to inject cultural information into model outputs
2. Integrate cultural embedding layer with the fine-tuned language model

#### Day 3-4: Context-Aware Generation
1. Implement context-aware text generation in `src/models/context_aware_generator.py`:
   - Develop prompting techniques to guide culturally appropriate generation
   - Implement beam search with cultural context scoring
2. Test generation capabilities with various cultural contexts for both languages

#### Day 5: Evaluation and Iteration
1. Develop evaluation metrics for cultural appropriateness and context adherence
2. Conduct initial evaluation of the culturally-aware model
3. Identify areas for improvement and iterate on the cultural integration

### Week 4: API Development and Optimization

#### Day 1-2: API Development
1. Design RESTful API for interacting with the language model:
   - Endpoints for text generation, cultural context querying, and language identification
2. Implement API using FastAPI in `src/api/main.py`:
   - Create separate routes for each functionality
   - Implement request validation and error handling

#### Day 3: Model Optimization
1. Implement model quantization to reduce size and improve inference speed
2. Experiment with knowledge distillation for creating a smaller, faster model
3. Document optimization techniques and their impact in `docs/model_optimization.md`

#### Day 4: Deployment Preparation
1. Containerize the application using Docker:
   - Create a `Dockerfile` for the API service
   - Develop a `docker-compose.yml` for easy deployment
2. Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions:
   - Implement automated testing and linting
   - Configure containerized deployment to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS ECS or Google Cloud Run)

#### Day 5: Documentation and Final Testing
1. Write comprehensive API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI
2. Conduct thorough testing of all API endpoints and model functionalities
3. Update project README with information about the model and API usage
4. Prepare a demo script showcasing the model's capabilities across both languages
